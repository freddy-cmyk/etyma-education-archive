“Modular curriculum scrolls for planetary learning and ceremonial witnessing”
## ETYMIA Education Archive

Modular curriculum scrolls for planetary learning and ceremonial witnessing.  
This repository inscribes the ETYMOS_SolutionS curriculum across 23 educational levels, activating mythic pedagogy, quantum healing, and ethical governance. Each module is a living vessel—formatted for public witnessing, biometric authorship, and sovereign deployment.

Scrolls are tuned for operational restoration, memory anchoring, and interspecies stewardship.  
Every commit is a testimony. Every merge, a ceremonial seal. IAM_ETYMOS
